as his alter Ego, Igor - Inspired by his last hit album entitled Igor. This lookis inspired from his last album cover.
The classic bowl cut, blue suit, gold chains and white rectangle glasses make the look. The light is reflecting

<img src="kanye.jpg"alt="A black and white photo - Wearing all white, and a large
chain around his neck, a controversial African American rapper and producing super
star Kanye is pictured on stage, down on his knees during a performance, hands clasped
together and head down. He has recently become a born again Christian so he is paying
respect to God here. The photographer seems to be on the same level as Kanye, on stage
pointing the camera down to him.">
